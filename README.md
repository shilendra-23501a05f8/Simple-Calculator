📘 About the Project – Simple Calculator App

The Simple Calculator is a Flutter-based mobile application developed to perform basic arithmetic operations in a clean, easy-to-use interface. It allows users to carry out essential calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — all on a single screen.

This project is built using the Flutter framework and Dart programming language, making it cross-platform and compatible with both Android and iOS devices. The app features a smooth and responsive design with color-coded buttons for numbers, operators, and functions to enhance user experience and readability.

The calculator logic is implemented through a custom expression evaluator written in Dart. It processes user input dynamically and displays real-time results. The app also includes features like a delete (⌫) button to remove a single character and a clear (C) button to reset the entire input.

The main objective of this project is to understand:

How Flutter widgets can be used to design an interactive UI

How to manage state efficiently using setState()

How to handle user events such as button presses

How to implement basic mathematical expression parsing and evaluation

Overall, the Simple Calculator App is an excellent introductory project for learning Flutter. It demonstrates essential concepts like UI design, event handling, and logical computation in a visually appealing and beginner-friendly manner.
